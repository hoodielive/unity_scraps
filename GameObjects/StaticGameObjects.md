1. Global Illumination: advanced lighting for a scene.
2. Occluder and Occuludee: rendering optimization based on the visibility of objects from specific camera positions.
3. Batching: rendering optimization that combines several objects into one larger object.
4. Navigation: the system that enables characters to negotiate obstacles in the scene.
5. Off-Mesh Links: connections made by the Navigation system between discontinuous areas of the scene.
